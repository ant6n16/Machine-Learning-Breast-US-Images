# Machine-Learning-Breast-US-Images

This repository contains the archives created for a project of the subject of Medical Imaging of the master in Telecommunications Engineering. The purpose of this project is to perform an extraction of characteristics of ultrasound images of mammary tumors to discern if they are benign or malignant. Once the characteristics have been extracted, we will address different machine learning techniques to classify tumors as benign or malignant.
Images can be downloaded at https://www.kaggle.com/aryashah2k/breast-ultrasound-images-dataset.
